title: Artifact Packaging
order: 30
---

Artifacts must be packaged to ease evaluation and use, including [instructions](#instructions) for the artifact and an [artifact appendix](#artifact-appendix).
Packaging is not only about evaluation but about future use of the artifact by other researchers who may want to build on top of it or use it as a baseline.

If you have further questions about how best to package your artifact, contact the AEC chairs at [aec-chairs@caisconf.org](mailto:aec-chairs@caisconf.org).


## Instructions

Follow the packaging guide for artifact authors [here](/packaging-guide).

Also see the [badges](badges) page for more details on what the instructions should contain.


## Artifact Appendix


The artifact appendix is a self-contained document up to **2 pages** that provides a roadmap for evaluators. In particular, it should include a description of the hardware, software, and configuration requirements, as well as a **list of the major claims** made in the paper that can be reproduced using your artifact.

Linking the paper's claims to the artifact is a necessary step that enables evaluators to reproduce your results. It is especially important to state your paper's key results and claims clearly. You should also make your claims about the artifact concrete. This is particularly important if those claims differ from the expectations set by your paper.

The AEC members will still evaluate your artifact relative to your paper, but your explanation can help set expectations up front, especially in cases that might otherwise frustrate evaluators. For example, inform the AEC about difficulties they might encounter when using the artifact or about the artifact's maturity relative to the content of the paper.

An artifact appendix must provide details on the time and hardware resources (e.g., storage) required to run the experiments in your paper. If possible, the appendix should also describe how to compare the results of a reproduced experiment with those reported in the paper (e.g., by providing access to the underlying dataset).

The intention for the artifact appendix is to be published in conjunction with your artifact, using an ACM official [LaTeX template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). For further information, please check ACM CAIS'26 [formatting requirements](https://www.caisconf.org/pages/cfp/).
