title: Call for AEC Members
order: 60
---

We are looking for reviewers who can provide detailed, constructive evaluations of 1-2 artifacts during the ACM CAIS'26 AE [review period](call). AEC members evaluate artifact quality, reproducibility, and relevance; provide clear feedback to help authors improve their work; and participate in committee discussions on artifact badge decisions. In return, they gain early insight into emerging research, opportunities to connect with peers in the community, and recognition for their service on the ACM CAIS [website](https://www.caisconf.org/) and, potentially, in the conference proceedings.

How to Apply
------------

If you are interested in taking part in the AEC, please nominate yourself using [this form](https://forms.gle/tc7xca6PaYFqyYqW7) by **Sunday, April 12, 2026**.

You can reach us at [aec-chairs@caisconf.org](mailto:aec-chairs@caisconf.org) with any questions.

AEC responsabilities
--------------------

As an AEC member, you will contribute to the reproducibility of experimental results in systems research by evaluating artifacts associated with papers accepted for publication at ACM CAIS'26. For each artifact, you will be asked to evaluate its public availability, functionality, and ability to reproduce the results reported in the paper. You will be able to discuss artifacts with other AEC members and interact anonymously with the authors when necessary. Finally, you will submit a review with constructive feedback, discuss the artifact with fellow reviewers, and help determine artifact evaluation badge outcomes.

We expect each AEC member to evaluate 1-2 artifacts, and we estimate that each evaluation will take around 10-20 hours. AEC members are expected to allocate time to indicate their artifact preferences and, once assigned, read the corresponding papers, evaluate the artifacts, and participate in online discussions through each notification deadline. Please ensure that you have sufficient time and availability during the AEC [reviewing period](call) and can carry out the evaluation confidentially and independently, without sharing artifacts or related information outside the AEC.

We expect evaluators to be able to use conference-provided cloud resources when available, particularly for artifacts that require substantial compute capacity or specialized hardware. Evaluators may also use their own machines when artifacts support local execution (including via containers or virtual machines, where appropriate). If neither option is suitable, authors may provide remote access to their own systems (e.g., via SSH) with proper anonymization. Commercial cloud services should be used only as a last resort and only with prior coordination with the authors and conference organizers to minimize unnecessary costs.
