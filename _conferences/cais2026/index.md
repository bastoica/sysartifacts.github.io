The Artifact Evaluation (AE) process is a community service intended to strengthen the long-term value of accepted papers by encouraging authors to provide substantial supplementary materials for review. These artifacts enable future researchers to reproduce, compare, and extend prior work more effectively. ACM CAIS invites authors of accepted papers to submit their artifacts for evaluation. Research artifacts are digital objects developed by the authors for use in the reported study or generated during the experimental process.

Artifact evaluation is optional at [ACM CAIS'26](https://www.caisconf.org/). Authors of accepted papers may submit their artifacts shortly after receiving the acceptance notification, but they are strongly encouraged to prepare these materials in advance. If an artifact passes evaluation, the paper will receive one or more official ACM AE badges displayed on its first page, and the final camera-ready version must include an appendix describing the artifact. For more information about the AE timeline, see the [important dates](dates) page.

The AE process for ACM CAIS'26 is *single-blind*, meaning that reviewers will know the identities of the authors, but authors will not know which Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) members reviewed their artifacts. To preserve reviewer anonymity, authors should not embed analytics or other tracking tools in websites hosting their artifacts during the artifact evaluation period. In cases where tracking is unavoidable, authors should notify the AEC Chairs in advance so that AEC members can take appropriate precautions.
